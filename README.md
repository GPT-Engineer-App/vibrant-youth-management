# vibrant-youth-management

This project is for an educational student organization's management app aimed at its members. It should feature a vibrant, youth-inspired design with blue and pink colors and bold, readable fonts in Japanese. The app should include a main page for login, allowing individuals to access their own page. It needs child pages for profile editing where members can add their profile picture, name, and a bio. There's also a home main page, with child pages for task management (viewing assigned tasks), task requests, a time card system (with activity time ranking), viewing and uploading recordings of missed meetings, an internal schedule calendar (with department-specific events), a link to Zoom for meetings, and various chat rooms categorized by management members, project members, community members, PR department, finance department, HR department, and individual chats, along with casual video calls for chatting. Additionally, the app should have a feature for issuing activity certificates based on activity time and content, and a page for viewing profiles of all organization members.
